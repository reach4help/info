# COVID-19 Neighborhood Assistance Project

This project is part of [Helpful Engineering](hhttps://www.helpfulengineering.org/),
a collection of "Helpful Engineers"
who have congregated to help in the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic.

This project is currently still in the proposal stage,
but we're already marching ahead to get a head-start,
in anticipation of it advancing beyond that stage.

[See proposal document](https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources/blob/master/software/proposals/neighbourhood_assistance.md).

## Project Description

People who are at high risk from COVID-19 or are quarantined are unable to leave their houses and obtain necessities like food and medical supplies without putting themselves or others at risk. We aim to facilitate support requests for these people and act as a bridge between them and reputable volunteer organizations that can help, such as government organizations, churches and local Red Cross establishments. These organizations are all reputable and conduct the appropriate background checks on their volunteers to ensure that no foul play happens. After all, we’re trying to create a safe and familiar environment that people can count on.

We’ve reached out to a few organizations for partnerships and one of them, Vizinho Amigo, expressed concerns about coordinating their volunteer workforce to aid those in need. Going forward as we expand, we aim to create a solution to not only enable those in need to receive help, but also to enable our partners to help more efficiently by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of our own tracking and ticketing system.
