# Reach4Help

This project is part of [Helpful Engineering](hhttps://www.helpfulengineering.org/),
a collection of "Helpful Engineers"
who have congregated to help in the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic.

This project is currently still in the proposal stage,
but we're already marching ahead to get a head-start,
in anticipation of it advancing beyond that stage.

[See proposal document](https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources/blob/master/software/proposals/neighbourhood_assistance.md).

## Description

People who are at high risk from COVID-19 or are quarantined are unable to leave their houses and obtain necessities like food and medical supplies without putting themselves or others at risk. We aim to facilitate support requests for these people and act as a bridge between them and reputable volunteer organizations that can help, such as government organizations, churches and local Red Cross establishments. These organizations are all reputable and conduct the appropriate background checks on their volunteers to ensure that no foul play happens. After all, we’re trying to create a safe and familiar environment that people can count on.

We’ve reached out to a few organizations for partnerships and one of them, Vizinho Amigo, expressed concerns about coordinating their volunteer workforce to aid those in need. Going forward as we expand, we aim to create a solution to not only enable those in need to receive help, but also to enable our partners to help more efficiently by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of our own tracking and ticketing system.

## Project Status

### Repositories

All of our main repositories are hosted under the
[reach4help](https://github.com/reach4help) org,
including:
  * [`API Backend`](https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help/tree/master/api)
  * [`Web Client Frontend`](https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help/tree/master/web-client)

### Infrastructure and Deployment

We will be using heroku in the early stages of the project to deploy to a test domain. 
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/reach4help


### UX & Design

We have an initial Mural UX mockup for the app that you can see [here](https://app.mural.co/t/projectneighborhoodassistanc9176/m/projectneighborhoodassistanc9176/1584396026453
).

We're actively working on the UX / Workflow [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/4d81f65a-86b5-4684-b221-f67781b372f5).

And some initial Figma design mockups [here](https://www.figma.com/file/OiU7Tl4k1YFfqZQXxLaRrl/Neighborhood-Assistance?node-id=0%3A1)!

### MVP Workflow:
*Volunteer*
- Users can register to volunteer using Facebook ID login (restricting users with accounts created for less than 6 months). If the user doesn't have Facebook we can provide and email for them to contact but we shouldn't waste too much time in this phase;
- User will be notified of cases near to them (eventually in real-time push notifications); they can then pick them up or not do anything; we might filter the notification messages inside of the app to only show the cases that are still open at the moment the user opens the notifications menu;
- Once the user understands the request is met, they can close the case as solved.
- User should agree to have their name and rating be public (+rep).
 
*Person In Need (PIN)*
- User can register via phone number. We confirm with SMS/verification code;
- Onboarding process to register person, address, etc. If registration is for another person it might be a good idea to add a phone number to call in case of request assignment. For example to enable an elder person to receive a phone call by the volunteer assigned to its request;
- Create request;
- Be notified when request is assigned;                   
  - Extra step asking if PIN wants to accept volunteer
- Receive their requested goods/care. Volunteer should have the power to change the request status to solved, but PIN has final say. 
  - If the PIN has access to the app (e.g. is not elderly/owns a smartphone) they can confirm the status change. 
  - If the PIN cannot do the status confirmation via app, follow up to verify if the request was fulfilled.
