## Use of Checkr

* Pedro went to site to try it out, US only
* Pedro tried out the Uber driver sign up, they ask for a lot more information about driver, ID, car, license etc… 
* Tried to find a similar one in portugal, unsuccessful so far, not time for deep research

## Existing Neighborhood Volunteer and Help System

* Pedro: Serves more as inspiration for us in terms of simplicity.
* Isn’t possible for cross-organizational efforts where different organisations can serve different needs.
* Keep it modular so we can change our minds

## Decisions

### Brand Name & Domains

* Decision: stick with one domain, international, use covid (not corona, not scientific and trademarked).
* Decide between covidaid.app, covidaid.help and covidaid.support

### Gatsby Theme for Landing Page

https://helpfulengineering.slack.com/archives/G01090WULHL/p1584563561041200

* Decided on https://gatsby-starter-mate.netlify.com/

### Product Vision & Workflow & MVP finalizing

https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/4d81f65a-86b5-4684-b221-f67781b372f5

* Org first or PIN first?
* MVP: require facebook auth + individual volunteers only, while we get this out, work on org infrastructure allowing for org to take responsibility for volunteers

### Typescript vs Vanilla JS

* Typescript is a go!
* Want to enable prettier and eslint / tslint

### Monorepo vs Multi-Repo

* Moving forward with yarn workspaces

### Anything Else

* Fundraising (e.g. open collective?)
  * Pay for: e.g. gsuite, domains etc… (other things that are only free when we are a registered NGO)
* Legal team, Jon has prodded the legal team, seem to be somewhat unorganized atm, challenging to get anyone to respond, will continue to prod.
* Security / Identity validation
  * Facebook auth could be a loose auth and validation for people’s identities
  * Requiring it for volunteers but not for PINs could be a good MVP
  * Requiring conditions for validation, e.g. 6+ months old, has 10 friends etc…
  * MVP: require facebook auth + individual volunteers only, while we get this out, work on org infrastructure allowing for org to take responsibility for volunteers
  * consensus!!!
* Keep things modular
  * For better ability to change things going forwards, keeping things modular and grouping the schema in a way we can easily add or remove features.
* Technology Choices
  * Jon: Once we have a clear vision of how the project is going to look, that will be the right point at which to make decisions about the technology.
* New designer, Cynthia:
  * Okay to add more designers
